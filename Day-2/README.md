# ðŸ›’ Day 2 â€“ Building an E-Commerce Store with React & Next.js

Welcome back! On Day 2, we leveled up by starting a basic **e-commerce website**â€”similar to Flipkartâ€”using **Next.js** and **React**.

## âœ… What We Did

- Created a new Next.js project for our e-commerce store
- Designed a simple homepage with product listings
- Made reusable components like `Navbar`, `ProductCard`, and `Footer`
- Displayed dummy product data using `props` and `.map()`
- Linked product pages using Next.js dynamic routing
- Added some basic styles with CSS Modules

## ðŸ›  Project Setup

To start your own store from scratch:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest ecommerce-store
cd ecommerce-store
npm run dev
